            <li>Generate a Menu Item Sales report for these dates and compare to your Counting and Claiming Excel to ensure your Academy and College Prep meal counts are accurate.</li>
            <li>Verify ADA for these dates with your SIS. If your SIS has a larger number for attendance, please provide us with that documentation by replying to this email.</li>
            <li>If you must edit meals, please do so before <b>2024-06-23</b>.</li>
            <li>If edits are made to meal counts, be sure to update your FPRs to reflect the updated meal counts.</li>
