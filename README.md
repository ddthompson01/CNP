  - Approach
    - I first cleaned and organized all the data files for easier searchablility. 
    - Next, I formatted Midland to merge middle school into college prep to caclulate attendance properly.
    - I then created a function to calculate attendance for all ada files. 
    - I created a function to find all non compliant issues. I compared attendance with the total meal count. If the total meal count was > attenance, an email is generated and sent to a cafeteria manager. If there is no manager for the campus, it is sent directly to the regional manager.
    - I created an html e-mail template that matches the one shown in the pdf.
    - I then created a function to generate an email preview for testing purposes. A screenshot is shown below:

    - Lastly, I input print statements throughout my functions to indicate on the terminal what stage the automation is at. A screenshot is shown below:
